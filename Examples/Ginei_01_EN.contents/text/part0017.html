			<h4 class="bmh3">Usurper of the Sun—Housuke Nojiri</h4>
			<p class="abmp">Aki Shiraishi is a high school student working in the astronomy club and one of the few witnesses to an amazing event—someone is building a tower on the planet Mercury. Soon, the Builders have constructed a ring around the sun, threatening the ecology of Earth with an immense shadow. Aki is inspired to pursue a career in science, and the truth. She must determine the purpose of the ring and the plans of its creators, as the survival of both species—humanity and the alien Builders—hangs in the balance.</p>

			<h4 class="bmh3">The Ouroboros Wave—Jyouji Hayashi</h4>
			<p class="abmp">Ninety years from now, a satellite detects a nearby black hole scientists dub Kali for the Hindu goddess of destruction. Humanity embarks on a generations-long project to tap the energy of the black hole and establish colonies on planets across the solar system. Earth and Mars and the moons Europa (Jupiter) and Titania (Uranus) develop radically different societies, with only Kali, that swirling vortex of destruction and creation, and the hated but crucial Artificial Accretion Disk Development association (AADD) in common.</p>
			<h4 class="bmh3">Ten Billion Days and One Hundred Billion Nights—Ryu Mitsuse</h4>
			<p class="abmp">Ten billion days—that is how long it will take the philosopher Plato to determine the true systems of the world. One hundred billion nights—that is how far into the future Jesus of Nazareth, Siddhartha, and the demigod Asura will travel to witness the end of all worlds. Named the greatest Japanese science fiction novel of all time, <span class="i1">Ten Billion Days and One Hundred Billion Nights</span> is an epic eons in the making. Originally published in 1967, the novel was revised by the author in later years and republished in 1973.</p>
