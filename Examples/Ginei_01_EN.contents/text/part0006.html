			<h3 class="h1aft">I</h3>
			<p class="paft">Imperial Navy captain Siegfried Kircheis froze for a moment when he stepped onto the bridge, standing riveted in place in spite of himself. The depths of space were before him, scattered with countless points of light—overwhelmingly massive, seeming to envelop his entire body.</p>
			<p class="p">For a moment, he stood there silent, but an instant later, the illusion that he was floating in an infinity of blackness disappeared. The bridge of the battleship <span class="i">Brünhild,</span> Kircheis knew, was designed in the form of a gigantic hemisphere, the upper half of which was a single display screen. Dragging his senses away from the sky and back down to the ground, Kircheis took another look around the bridge.</p>
			<p class="p">The illumination in the vast chamber was extremely muted, creating a crepuscular dimness. Crew were moving to and fro amid countless screens, consoles, meters, computers, and communication devices of all sizes. The movements of their heads and limbs brought to mind schools of migratory fish swimming in the currents.</p>
			<p class="p">Kircheis’s nostrils detected the faint tang of an almost imperceptible odor. It was one with which soldiers in space were well acquainted, produced by the blending of recycled oxygen, ozone given off by machinery, and adrenaline secreted by tense soldiers who would soon be facing combat.</p>
			<p class="p">The young red-haired man turned to face the center of the bridge and walked toward it with long strides. Although he held the rank of captain, Kircheis was not yet twenty-one. When he was out of uniform, he was “nothing but a handsome, redheaded beanpole,” as the female officers in the rear service whispered. From time to time, it bothered him that his age and his rank were so out of proportion to one another. He wasn’t able to accept his circumstances in the cool, calm way that his commanding officer did.</p>
			<p class="p">Count Reinhard von Lohengramm had his command chair tilted backward and was staring intently into the sea of stars that flooded over the display screen above. Kircheis felt a soft resistance from the air as he drew near. A soundproof force screen was up. Conversations taking place within a five-meter radius of Reinhard would be inaudible to anyone on the outside.</p>
			<p class="p">“Stargazing, Excellency?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="p">A moment after hearing Kircheis’s voice, Reinhard shifted his line of sight and returned his chair to an upright position. Although he was still sitting down, his uniform—functional and black, with silver highlights here and there—made clear the tight masculinity of his slender, well-balanced limbs.</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard was a handsome young man. One might even say that his good looks were without peer. His white, oval face was adorned on three sides with slightly curling golden hair, and his lips and the bridge of his nose had an elegance that brought to mind a sculpture carved by the hands of some ancient master craftsman.</p>
			<p class="p">But what could never be captured in lifeless sculpture were his eyes—ice-blue eyes that shone with light like the blade of a keenly polished sword, or the gleam of some frozen star. “Beautiful ambitious eyes,” gossiped the ladies at court. “Dangerous ambitious eyes,” whispered the men. Either way, it was certain that those eyes possessed something other than the inorganic perfection of sculpture.</p>
			<p class="p">Looking up at his faithful subordinate, Reinhard answered, “Yes, I love the stars.” Then he added, “Have you gotten taller again?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I’m the same 190 centimeters that I was two months ago, Excellency. I don’t think I’m going to grow any taller.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Seven centimeters taller than me is certainly plenty,” Reinhard replied. In the sound of his voice was the ring of an overcompetitive schoolboy. Kircheis smiled faintly. Until about six years ago, there had been virtually no difference in their heights. But when Kircheis’s growth spurt had begun to put a distance between himself and Reinhard, the blond-haired lad had been genuinely frustrated. “Are you going to leave your friend behind and just grow up by yourself?” he had sometimes complained. That was the childish side of Reinhard, of which only Kircheis—and one other—knew.</p>
			<p class="p">“I see,” Reinhard replied. “So, what business brings you up here?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Yes, sir. It’s the battle formation of the rebel military. According to reports from three of our surveillance craft, they are closing in on our forces from three directions at uniform velocity. May I use your console’s display?”</p>
			<p class="p">The young senior admiral nodded assent, and Kircheis moved his hands rhythmically over the console. On the display screen occupying the left half of Reinhard’s command console, four arrows floated into existence, positioned at the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen, and all were advancing toward the center. Only the arrow at the bottom of the screen was colored red. The other three were green.</p>
			<p class="p">“The enemy’s Fourth Fleet lies directly ahead of us, and we estimate that its force numbers twelve thousand vessels. Its distance from us is 2,200 light-seconds. At our current velocities, we will make contact in about six hours.”</p>
			<p class="p">Kircheis moved his finger around the screen. On the left side was the alliance’s Second Fleet, with a force of fifteen thousand vessels, approaching from a distance of 2,400 light-seconds. On the right side was the Sixth Fleet, numbering thirteen thousand vessels, advancing from a distance of 2,050 light-seconds.</p>
			<p class="p">With the development of the antigravity field system—along with all manner of radar-permeability devices, ECM waves, and materials that rendered radar useless in determining the position and strength of enemy forces centuries ago, the militaries of the galaxy had turned back to reliance on classical methods such as manned surveillance craft and observation satellites. After calculating the time differences and factoring in the element of distance, intelligence gathered in this manner could then be used to learn the enemy’s position. Add to this the estimated levels of heat emission and mass, and a usable—if imperfect—calculation of force size could also be obtained.</p>
			<p class="p">“So in total forty thousand ships, eh? Twice the size of our fleet.”</p>
			<p class="p">“They’re attempting to envelop us by coming in from three directions.”</p>
			<p class="p">“And I suppose our senile old generals have all gone pale in their faces … or red, perhaps.” Reinhard allowed a spiteful smile to flash across his fair-skinned face. Though he had just been told that he was being surrounded by a force twice the size of his own, not a hint of panic was visible in Reinhard’s expression.</p>
			<p class="p">“Pale, without a doubt,” replied Kircheis. “The five admirals have come here in haste to request a meeting with Your Excellency.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Oh? After they shot off their mouths saying they didn’t even want to see my face?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Do you decline to meet with them?”</p>
			<p class="p">“No, I’ll see them. In order to enlighten them.”</p>
			<p class="p">The five men who appeared before Reinhard were Admiral Merkatz, vice admirals Staden and Fogel, and rear admirals Fahrenheit and Erlach. These were the “senile old generals” of whom Reinhard had spoken, though perhaps that term was too harsh. Merkatz—the eldest of them—was not yet sixty, and the youngest—Fahrenheit—was only thirty-one. It was not that they were too old, but that Reinhard and Kircheis were too young.</p>
			<p class="p">“Our thanks, Your Excellency,” Merkatz said, speaking for all of them, “for permitting us to offer our opinions.” Merkatz had joined the service long before Reinhard had been born, and was rich in knowledge and experience of both combat and military administration. His medium-height, thick-boned build and sleepy-looking eyes gave him the appearance of an unremarkable middle-aged man, but his record and reputation were far greater than those of the likes of Reinhard.</p>
			<p class="p">Taking the initiative, Reinhard politely replied, “I understand what you wish to say, milords.” In form only, he was following the etiquette that Merkatz had displayed. “You wish to bring our disadvantaged circumstances to my attention.”</p>
			<p class="p">“We do, Your Excellency,” answered Vice Admiral Staden, advancing a half step forward. Staden was in his midforties, slender as a knife, and gave the impression of a man with a very sharp mind. As a soldier, he was the “staff officer” type who excelled in tactical theory and speech-making.</p>
			<p class="p">“The enemy has double the number of ships that we do. Moreover, they are attempting to envelop us from three directions. This means that in terms of battle readiness, we are trailing behind the enemy already.”</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard’s ice-blue eyes gleamed coldly as he looked straight at the vice admiral. “In other words, you are saying that we will lose?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I said nothing of the sort, Excellency. But it is a fact that we are at a disadvantage in terms of preparedness. If you’ll look at your display screen, you’ll understand.”</p>
			<p class="p">Seven sets of eyes focused on Reinhard’s console display.</p>
			<p class="p">The positions of the two opposing forces, as Kircheis had shown to Reinhard, were indicated there. From outside the sound-deadening field, a number of soldiers were casting deeply curious glances at the high-ranking commanders. Then, at a glare from Vice Admiral Staden, they all hurriedly averted their eyes. After pausing to clear his throat, the vice admiral began to speak again.</p>
			<p class="p">“Many years ago, a fleet that was the pride of the empire was delivered a most regrettable defeat by the rebels of the so-called Free Planets Alliance. This is the same formation that they used then.”</p>
			<p class="p">“You speak of the Dagon Annihilation, correct?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I do. It was a truly regrettable defeat.” A deep, heavy sigh escaped the vice admiral’s lips. “Victory in that battle rightfully belonged to humanity’s true ruler—His Highness, the emperor of the Galactic Empire—and to his faithful servants, the officers and soldiers of our military. But they were caught off guard by the rebel forces’ cunning trick, and in the end, a million of our bravest, best, and brightest died meaningless deaths. If—in the coming battle—we were to follow in the footsteps of those who came before us, it would be certain to bring grief to His Highness, so—it was my foolish thinking, but would it not be wiser to make an honorable withdrawal now, rather than rushing impetuously forward in pursuit of achievement?”</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">Foolish thinking indeed, you worse-than-incompetent blatherer</span>, Reinhard thought. But when he opened his mouth, he said, “I acknowledge your eloquence, milord. Your argument, however, I cannot accept. Withdrawal is out of the question.”</p>
			<p class="p">“But … why? May we hear your reasoning?”</p>
			<p class="p">The look that rose up in Vice Admiral Staden’s eyes seemed to append, <span class="i">you unteachable whelp</span>, but taking no mind of it, Reinhard replied, “Because we are in a position of overwhelming tactical advantage over the enemy.”</p>
			<p class="p">“What do you mean?” Staden’s eyebrows quivered noticeably. The admirals all stared at the handsome young commander—Merkatz dumbfoundedly, and Fogel and Erlach in utter shock.</p>
			<p class="p">Only Fahrenheit—the youngest of the five—had a look of interest brimming in his light-aquamarine eyes. Born into lower-class aristocracy, Fahrenheit openly professed that he had become a soldier in order to eat. He had an established reputation as a planner of high-mobility, high-speed attacks, though it was also said that he was lacking in tenacity when it came to intercepting attacks.</p>
			<p class="p">“It would seem you have an opinion that is difficult for dullards such as ourselves to understand. We would be grateful if you could explain your meaning in more detail.”</p>
			<p class="p">Vice Admiral Staden’s voice grated on Reinhard’s ears. Thinking to himself, <span class="i">I’ll rip that irritating tongue of yours out the day after tomorrow</span>, Reinhard granted his request: “I said that we have the advantage for two reasons. First, the enemy forces are divided along these three vectors, while our forces are concentrated in one place. While the enemy has the advantage in terms of overall numbers, we have the advantage over any of these three divisions.”</p>
			<p class="p">The admirals listened, saying nothing.</p>
			<p class="p">“Secondly, when it comes to moving from one battlespace to the next, our force—which is located in the center—is able to take a shorter route than any of them. In order for them to move to another battlespace without fighting us, they will have to make a wide detour. This makes both time and distance our allies.”</p>
			<p class="p">The silence of the admirals stretched on.</p>
			<p class="p">“In other words, we exceed the enemy in both mobility and concentration of firepower. If these are not the conditions for victory, what would you call them?”</p>
			<p class="p">In a sharp, cutting tone of voice, Reinhard finished speaking. Kircheis thought for a moment that the five admirals had frozen into crystal on the spot. Reinhard had turned the thinking of the older, more experienced military men on its head.</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard transfixed the shocked, unmoving Vice Admiral Staden with an ironic gaze, pressing his advantage.</p>
			<p class="p">“We are in no danger of envelopment. We have a fine opportunity to destroy the enemy on each vector. You tell me not to make the most of this opportunity and to make a meaningless withdrawal, but to do so would not be merely passive—it would be criminal. Why? Because our mission is to do battle with the rebel forces and destroy them. ‘An honorable withdrawal,’ you said. But where is the honor in failing to complete the mission with which His Imperial Highness has charged us? Does this not resemble the self-justification of a coward, milord?”</p>
			<p class="p">At the mention of “His Imperial Highness,” a ripple of tension ran through the bodies of four of the admirals, excluding Fahrenheit. Reinhard thought it all absurd.</p>
			<p class="p">“So you say, Commander,” began Staden, attempting to plead with him. “But although Your Excellency may call this a ‘fine opportunity,’ you are the only one here who believes it to be so. Even from the standpoint of commonsense tactics, it is impossible to accept. For a strategy which has no proven track record—”</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">This one’s not just incompetent, he’s an imbecile,</span> Reinhard concluded.<span class="i"> An unprecedented operation can’t have a track record. Its record will begin with the coming battle, will it not? </span>Speaking aloud, he said, “Then tomorrow, milord, you will verify its record with your own eyes. Is that not acceptable?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Are you certain of success?” asked Staden.</p>
			<p class="p">“I am. But only if all of you follow my strategy faithfully.”</p>
			<p class="p">“What kind of strategy?” Staden asked, making no attempt to hide his suspicion.</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard glanced at Kircheis for a moment and then began to explain the operation.</p>
			<p class="p">Two minutes later, the interior of the soundproof field was filled with the sound of Staden’s shouts.</p>
			<p class="p">“That sounds fine on paper, but there is no way it will actually work, Excellency. This kind of—”</p>
			<p class="p">“Enough! There’s no need for further debate. His Imperial Majesty named me as commander for this operation. Your obedience to my commands must needs be interpreted as proof of your loyalty toward His Majesty. Is that not the duty of a soldier of the empire? Do not forget: I am your commanding officer.”</p>
			<p class="p">A moment passed in silence.</p>
			<p class="p">“All authority over your lives rests in my hands. If you wish of your own accord to defy the will of His Highness, very well. I will simply use the authority he has vested in me to relieve you of duty and to punish you severely as insubordinates. Are you prepared to go to those lengths?”</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard glared at the five men standing before him. They did not answer.</p>
			<div class="keep"><h3 class="h">II</h3>
			<p class="paft">The five admirals departed. They neither accepted nor consented, but they did find it difficult to oppose the authority of the emperor. Only Fahrenheit’s expression could have been interpreted as favorable toward Reinhard’s plan for the coming operations, but the expressions of the other four were to varying degrees saying, “How dare that brat brandish the emperor’s authority!”</p>
			</div>
			<p class="p">For Kircheis, circumstances were forming in which it was a bit difficult to remain silent. Even without all this, Reinhard had a bad reputation as an overly young upstart. From the standpoint of these veteran commanders, Reinhard was nothing more than a weak little asteroid, giving off no light of his own, using the influence of his sister Annerose to borrow the power of the emperor.</p>
			<p class="p">It was not as though this were Reinhard’s first campaign, though. In the five years since he had enlisted, he had already emerged victorious in a number of battles. But if someone were to tell that to the commanders, they would only say something like, “He was in a good unit” or “The enemy was too weak.”</p>
			<p class="p">And because it was difficult to say that Reinhard was humble and courteous in all matters, their antipathy toward him had been amplified, and now in the shadows he was widely referred to as “that impudent golden brat.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Are you sure about this?” the red-haired youth asked Reinhard, a look of anxiety rising up in his blue eyes.</p>
			<p class="p">“Leave me alone,” his commanding officer said calmly. “What can they do? They’re cowards who can’t even make a nasty remark individually—they have to come in a group. They haven’t the courage to defy the emperor’s authority.”</p>
			<p class="p">“But what little courage they have may gather in the shadows.”</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard looked at his aide-de-camp and gave a low, amused laugh. “You’re still the same old worrier. But there’s nothing to fret about. Even though they’re full of grievances now, that situation will change in a single day. And I’ll show that idiot Staden a framed copy of the ‘track record’ he loves so much.”</p>
			<p class="p">Saying that he’d had enough of such talk, Reinhard rose from his chair and invited Kircheis to come to his cabin for a break. “Let’s have a drink, Kircheis. I’ve got some good wine. It’s supposed to be a rare 410 vintage.”</p>
			<p class="p">“That sounds wonderful.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, then, let’s go. And by the way, Kircheis—”</p>
			<p class="p">“Yes, Excellency?”</p>
			<p class="p">“That ‘Excellency’ thing. There’s no need to go around calling me that when nobody else is with us. Talk to me like you always have.”</p>
			<p class="p">“I understand what you’re saying, but—”</p>
			<p class="p">“If you understand it, then do it. Because when this battle is over and we return to Odin, people will be calling you ‘Excellency’ as well.”</p>
			<p class="p">Kircheis said nothing.</p>
			<p class="p">“You’ll be promoted to commodore. Look forward to it.”</p>
			<p class="p">Leaving the bridge to Captain Reuschner, Reinhard set out for his private room. Following behind him, Kircheis ruminated over what his commanding officer had said to him.</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">When this battle is over and we return, you’ll be made a commodore … </span>It seemed that defeat wasn’t in the young, blond-haired admiral’s mind at all. To anyone but Kircheis, those words would surely be taken for hopeless arrogance. But Kircheis knew that Reinhard had only been speaking out of affection for a dear friend.</p>
			<p class="p">A thought suddenly occurred to Kircheis: <span class="i">Has it already been ten years since we first met? </span>In meeting Reinhard and his sister Annerose, his destiny had changed forever.</p>
			<p class="p">Siegfried Kircheis’s father was a minor official who worked in the Ministry of Justice. Harried about every day by bosses, paperwork, and computers, he earned forty thousand imperial marks a year. He was a kind, ordinary man whose only two pleasures were raising some sort of Baldurian orchid in his narrow garden and drinking black beer after dinner. As for his little redheaded son, the boy somehow managed to dangle at the lower edge of the honor roll at school, was a powerhouse in sports, and was his parents’ pride and joy.</p>
			<p class="p">One day, a man and his two children moved into the house next door, which had been as good as abandoned.</p>
			<p class="p">Young Kircheis had been shocked when he first heard that the dispirited, middle-aged man was of the aristocracy, but when he saw the golden-haired brother and sister, he believed it. <span class="i">They’re so beautiful!</span> he had thought.</p>
			<p class="p">The next day, he met the younger brother. The boy named Reinhard was the same age as Kircheis, born only two months later according to the standard Space Era calendar. When the red-haired boy gave his name, the blond-haired boy’s well-shaped eyebrows had shot upward.</p>
			<p class="p">“Siegfried? What a vulgar name.”</p>
			<p class="p">At such an unexpected reply, the red-haired boy had been shocked and at a loss for how to reply.</p>
			<p class="p">Then Reinhard had continued, adding, “But Kircheis is a good last name. Very poetic. So I’ve decided to call you by your last name.”</p>
			<p class="p">On the other hand, his elder sister Annerose had abbreviated his given name, calling him “Sieg.” The features of her face bore a strong resemblance to those of her younger brother but were a step more delicate, and her faint little smile was infinitely gentle. When introduced to her by Reinhard, she had given him a smile that was like dappled sunlight streaming through the trees.</p>
			<p class="p">“Sieg, please be a good friend to my brother.”</p>
			<p class="p">From that day until now, Kircheis had obeyed her request faithfully.</p>
			<p class="p">A lot had happened since then. One day, a luxurious landcar that Kircheis had never seen before stopped in front of the house next door, and a middle-aged man wearing fine clothes stepped out. All through the night, the tearful voice of the indomitable Reinhard had lashed out unceasingly against his father.</p>
			<p class="p">“You sold my sister!” he cried.</p>
			<p class="p">The next morning, when Kircheis went over on the pretext of asking Reinhard to walk to school with him, Annerose had said with a gentle, sad smile, “My brother can’t go to school with you anymore. I know it was just for a short time, but thank you for being his friend.”</p>
			<p class="p">Then the beautiful young girl had kissed him on his forehead and given him a homemade chocolate torte. That day, the red-haired boy hadn’t gone to school. Instead, he had carefully carried the torte to a nature preserve, and, taking care not to be spotted by any patrol robots, had sat down in the shadow of some conifers—“Martian pines” they were called, for reasons no one knew—and there he had stayed for a long time, eating the torte. As he contemplated being separated from Annerose and Reinhard, tears had welled up in his eyes, and he had wiped them with his hands, leaving dark-brown stripes across his face.</p>
			<p class="p">When it was dark, he had returned home, preparing himself for a scolding, but his parents had said nothing. The lights were out at the house next door.</p>
			<p class="p">One month later, Reinhard had without warning come suddenly to visit, wearing the uniform of the Imperial Military Children’s Academy. The blond-haired boy had spoken to the shocked, thrilled Kircheis in the affected tones of an adult. “I’m going to be a soldier,” he had said. “It’s the fastest way to get ahead. And I have to get ahead in the world so I can set Annerose free. Kircheis, come to the same school as me, won’t you? They’re all louts at the Children’s Academy.”</p>
			<p class="p">His parents were not opposed to the idea. Perhaps they had been hoping that their son would be able to get ahead in the world that way, or perhaps they had realized that their son had already been stolen away from them by the brother and sister from the house next door. At any rate, Kircheis made the decision in his youth that he would walk the same road as Reinhard.</p>
			<p class="p">Most of the students at the Children’s Academy were the offspring of aristocrats, and the rest were all sons of eminent civilians. It was clear that Kircheis had only been admitted due to Reinhard’s earnest desire and Annerose’s intercession.</p>
			<p class="p">Reinhard’s marks usually put him at the top of his class, and Kircheis also placed high. Not just for his own sake, but also for Reinhard and Annerose, he could not afford to let his grades slip.</p>
			<p class="p">From time to time, the fathers and elder brothers of students would come to visit the school. All of them were aristocrats of high status, but Kircheis had no respect for them. He could smell the stench of men who had become arrogant in their privilege.</p>
			<p class="p">“Look at them, Kircheis,” Reinhard would whisper. Whenever he saw such nobles, his voice filled with an intense hatred and scorn. “They didn’t get to be where they are today through any effort of their own …  They inherited their authority and fortune from their fathers only by reason of blood, and they aren’t even ashamed of it. The universe does not exist to be dominated by such people.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Reinhard …” Kircheis would begin.</p>
			<p class="p">“It’s true, Kircheis! There’s not a shred of reason why you and I should have to stand downwind of their ilk.”</p>
			<p class="p">This kind of conversation had passed between them not a few times, but on one occasion, Reinhard said something that gave his red-haired friend the shock of his life.</p>
			<p class="p">They had just made a polite salute—a salute that was the sacred duty of all subjects of the empire—before one of the many statues of Emperor Rudolf that towered haughtily above every quarter of the capital. They dared not do otherwise, for the eyes of these statues were elaborate video cameras, and the Ministry of the Interior was ever watchful for dangerous elements who flouted imperial authority. It was after this salute that Reinhard began to speak passionately.</p>
			<p class="p">“Kircheis, have you ever thought about this? The Goldenbaum Dynasty doesn’t go all the way back to the dawn of humanity. It was founded by that arrogant, overbearing Rudolf. And the fact that there was a founder means that before he came to power, there was no imperial family, and he amounted to nothing more than a single, solitary citizen. There at the beginning, Rudolf was an ambitious upstart and nothing more. But in time, he ended up claiming titles like ‘Sacred and Inviolable Emperor.’ ”</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">What is he trying to tell me? </span>Kircheis had wondered as his heart began beating faster.</p>
			<p class="p">“Do you think that what was possible for Rudolf,” Reinhard had asked, “is impossible for me?”</p>
			<p class="p">Then, with thoughts that took his breath away, Kircheis had looked back into the gaze of Reinhard’s ice-blue, jewellike eyes. It had been winter, just before they entered the military service.</p>
			<div class="keep"><h3 class="h">III</h3>
			<p class="extaft">… from the twentieth century through the twenty-first century AD, one can produce many examples of the rampant technological development which threatened to rob humanity of its identity. In particular, the replication of human beings by cloning—one of the fruits of genetic engineering—was once mistakenly believed to be a guarantee of eternal life, despite the fact that only its theoretical possibilities had been demonstrated. When cloning was brought together with ideas of social Darwinism, fearsome ideologies that took a very light view of human life ran rampant across the face of the planet known as Earth. The opinion that those possessing inferior genes were unqualified to bear children and that inferior races should be weeded out for the qualitative improvement of the human race began to hold increasing sway. This was truly the first budding of the assertions that Rudolf von Goldenbaum would make in latter times …</p>
			</div>
			<p class="p">The passage that was displayed on the console’s tiny screen suddenly dimmed and faded out. Faster than one could push a control button, another passage appeared.</p>
			<p class="p">“Commodore Yang, the commander is calling for you. Please report to the conn as quickly as possible.”</p>
			<p class="p">His reading interrupted, Commodore Yang Wen-li grabbed his uniform beret and ran a hand through his unruly head of black hair. He was a junior staff officer in the Free Planets Alliance’s Second Fleet, occupying a seat in a corner of the bridge of its flagship, <span class="i">Patroklos</span>. Since he had been enjoying his private reading on a console originally intended as a tactical computer, there was no sense in feeling annoyed.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang’s Name Notation Type was “E.” This was a tradition carried over from the days of the federation. People whose family names came before their given names were designated “E,” which stood for “Eastern.” Those whose given names came before their family names were called “W,” for “Western.”</p>
			<p class="p">Of course, in this day and age, with the races having mixed as thoroughly as has they had, a person’s name was only a vague indicator of his or her direct ancestry.</p>
			<p class="p">The twenty-nine-year-old Yang, with his black hair, black eyes, and medium height and build, gave more the impression of an easygoing scholar than that of a soldier. At least that’s the impression one might describe if pressed. Most people who looked at him saw nothing more than a very quiet-natured young man. Most couldn’t believe their ears when they heard his rank.</p>
			<p class="p">“Commodore Yang, reporting as ordered, sir.”</p>
			<p class="p">The fleet commander, Vice Admiral Paetta, turned his unfriendly eyes on the young officer saluting him. He was a middle-aged man with stern, forbidding features that made it impossible to imagine him in any line of work but the military.</p>
			<p class="p">Observing Yang again, he simply said, “I’ve looked over the tactical plan you submitted,” though what he wanted to say was,<span class="i"> How in the world can a sissy-looking kid like you be only two ranks below me?! “</span>It was a fairly interesting idea,” he continued. “But too cautious. And I wonder if it wasn’t just a bit too passive.”</p>
			<p class="p">“You don’t say,” Yang answered. He said it in a very quiet tone of voice, but on reflection, it might have seemed a pretty rude thing to say to a commanding officer. Vice Admiral Paetta hadn’t noticed it, though.</p>
			<p class="p">“As you yourself noted,” he continued, “it would be pretty hard to lose with this strategy. But there’s no point in simply not losing. We’ve gotta win. We’re closing in on the enemy from three directions. And on top of that, we’ve got twice their numbers. All the conditions are lined up for a big win, so why are you thinking up ways to avoid losing?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, yeah, but it’s not like they’re surrounded already.”</p>
			<p class="p">This time Paetta did notice. His eyebrows drew together in irritation, making a splendid vertical crease in the midst of his forehead.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang was as relaxed as ever.</p>
			<p class="p">Nine years ago, when he had graduated from the National Defense Force Officers’ Academy, Yang had been an unremarkable, newly minted ensign. He had graduated 1,909th in his class of 4,840. But now, he could certainly not be called an unremarkable commodore. He was one of only sixteen officers in the entire alliance who had reached admiralty while still in their twenties.</p>
			<p class="p">It was impossible that Vice Admiral Paetta was unaware of the young commodore’s service record. In nine years, Yang had participated in over a hundred combat operations. And even though he hadn’t often been in large-scale battles involving thousands of vessels like this one, he hadn’t been just some kid playing with firecrackers, either. Above all else, he had been the shining hero of the so-called El Facil Evacuation.</p>
			<p class="p">Though he was young, he was the hero of a historic battle, and yet Vice Admiral Paetta didn’t get that impression from him at all. Still, when the officers’ salaries were calculated in the rear service at headquarters, it was clear that he was being well paid in accordance with his record.</p>
			<p class="p">“At any rate, this tactical plan is rejected.”</p>
			<p class="p">Paetta held the papers out to Yang, then added unnecessarily, “Let me also just say, this is nothing personal.”</p>
			<div class="keep"><h3 class="h">IV</h3>
			<p class="paft">Yang Wen-li’s father, Yang Tai-long, was known as a man of great ability among the many traders and merchants of the Free Planets Alliance. Beneath his inoffensive little smile, the wheels of a keen mind for business were turning, and since the day he had set out as the owner of a small commercial vessel, his fortune had grown steadily.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="p">“It’s because I dote on my money,” he would say to friends who asked him the secret of his success. “It goes out into the world and makes its fortune, and then it comes back home like a faithful child. Bronze coins turn into silver ones. Silver ones turn into gold. It all depends on their upbringing!”</p>
			<p class="p">As he himself seemed to think that this was a sharp-witted joke, he went around telling it every chance he got, eventually acquiring the nickname “The Financial-Parenting Expert.” It would be difficult to claim that this title was always spoken with affectionate intent, but Yang Tai-long himself was apparently quite happy with it.</p>
			<p class="p">In addition, Yang Tai-long was a collector of antique art. His residence was piled high with stacks of paintings, sculptures, and ceramics from the days when the AD calendar was still in use. Before he came to occupy an office and command a fleet of interstellar commerce vessels, he was always busy at home admiring and polishing his antiques.</p>
			<p class="p">After this hobby had metastasized, there were rumors that he had even chosen an antique as his spouse. For after divorcing his first wife—who had had a penchant for wasting money—he had married another woman of considerable beauty, who was, however, the widow of a certain soldier. Then his son, Yang Wen-li, had been born.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang Tai-long had been in his study at home when he received the news that it was a boy. His hands had paused for a moment in their polishing of an old vase, and he had muttered, “Huh. So when I’m gone, all these works of art will be his.”</p>
			<p class="p">Then his hands had resumed their polishing.</p>
			<p class="p">When Yang Wen-li was five years old, his mother died. The cause was acute heart disease, and since she had always been healthy up until that point, her sudden death understandably came as a shock to Yang Tai-long. He dropped a bronze lion ornament to the floor but then unexpectedly picked it back up and incensed his wife’s entire family by uttering these words:</p>
			<p class="p">“Thank goodness I wasn’t polishing something breakable …”</p>
			<p class="p">Yang Tai-long had now lost two wives—one to divorce and one to death—and he had no wish to marry again. He assigned a maid to take care of his son, but when the maid was on break or when the boy became difficult to manage, Yang Tai-long would set him down beside himself, and together they would polish a vase or something.</p>
			<p class="p">When the relatives of his late wife came to visit and found father and son wordlessly polishing vases in the study, they were horrified, and in the end the assertion emerged that the child should be rescued from living with such an irresponsible father. When they had cornered the father and asked him which was more important to him—his son or his antiques—he had replied:</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, the art required a lot of capital, you know …”</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">But on the other hand, I got my son for free</span>, being the implication.</p>
			<p class="p">The entire family, driven into a rage by these words, was preparing to take the matter of the boy’s custody to court, but Yang Tai-long guessed what they were up to, and carrying the boy with him, boarded an interstellar trading ship and disappeared from the capital of Heinessen. The family, realizing how absurd it would be to allege that a father had kidnapped his own son, shrugged their collective shoulders and did nothing beyond tracking where in the starry sky the spaceship had gone. “Oh well,” they said. “The fact that he took the boy with him must mean he at least has a beating heart.”</p>
			<p class="p">In this way, Yang Wen-li came to spend the greater part of his first sixteen years inside the hulls of starships.</p>
			<p class="p">In the beginning, the young Yang Wen-li would become ill and run fevers every time he experienced warp, but eventually he got used to it and was able to calmly accept his circumstances. Once he had generally satisfied his interest in engineering, he turned his attention in another direction: history.</p>
			<p class="p">The boy watched videos, read e-copies of old books, and loved listening to reminiscences about the past, but in particular, he held a deep interest in “the most wicked usurper in all of history,” Rudolf.</p>
			<p class="p">Because Yang Wen-li was in the Free Planets Alliance, Rudolf was naturally made out to be the very incarnation of evil, but in listening to what people said about him, the boy had begun to have his doubts. If Rudolf had really been such a villain, he wondered, then why had people supported him and given him power?</p>
			<p class="p">“Because he was dishonest to his marrow. He had the people fooled.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Why were the people fooled?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Because Rudolf was an evil man, y’see.”</p>
			<p class="p">These answers didn’t quite satisfy the boy, but his father’s view differed somewhat from those of the others he talked to. He answered his son’s inquiry in this way:</p>
			<p class="p">“Because the people wanted to have it easy.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Have it easy?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Exactly. They didn’t want to solve their own problems by their own effort. They were all waiting for some saint or superman to show up from somewhere and shoulder all their troubles by himself. And that’s what Rudolf took advantage of. Listen. I want you to remember this: it’s the ones who empower a dictator who deserve most of the blame. But the ones who don’t support him actively—who watch it happening without saying anything—they’re just as much to blame. But listen, don’t you think you should turn your interests in a more profitable direction than this kind of stuff?”</p>
			<p class="p">“More profitable?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Like money or artwork. Art for the soul, money for the pocket.”</p>
			<p class="p">Despite comments such as these, Yang Tai-long never forced his business or his hobbies on his son, and Yang Wen-li became more and more absorbed in history.</p>
			<p class="p">A few days before his son’s sixteenth birthday, Yang Tai-long died. It was the result of an accident involving his ship’s nuclear-fusion furnace. Yang Wen-li had decided to take the entrance examination for Heinnessen Memorial University’s history department, having only just recently gotten his father’s approval.</p>
			<p class="p">“Ah, why not?” he had said. “It’s not like there’s never been anyone to make money at history.”</p>
			<p class="p">With those words, the father had given his son his blessing to walk the path that he loved.</p>
			<p class="p">“Don’t ever despise money, though. If you’ve got it, you can get by without bowing your head to people you don’t like, and you don’t have to compromise your principles just to get along in life, either. But just like politicians, it’s best if we manage it well and not just do as we please with it.”</p>
			<p class="p">At the end of his forty-eight years, Yang Tai-long left behind his son, his company, and his huge collection of artwork.</p>
			<p class="p">After Yang Wen-li had finished with his father’s funeral, he was kept busy with mundane matters such as inheritance and taxes. And then he discovered the terrible truth: the works of art that his father had so passionately collected prior to his death were, almost without exception, counterfeit.</p>
			<p class="p">From the Etrurian vases to the rococo-style portraits to the bronze horses from imperial Han China, everything was “worth less than a single dinar,” as the government’s public appraiser told him by way of an expressionless underling.</p>
			<p class="p">And that wasn’t all. Prior to his death, his father had mortgaged his ownership of the company in order to cover his debts. In the end, Yang was left out in the cold with nothing but a mountain of junk.</p>
			<p class="p">But just as he had done when he was a child, Yang accepted the situation with a wry smile, mingled with a sigh. He did think it was rather odd that his wheeler-dealer of a father should lack an eye for value only when it came to his beloved works of art. If—just if—he had been knowingly collecting forgeries, Yang felt like that would have been just like his father. As for his father’s company, Yang had never had any desire to take over the business anyway, so he didn’t mind losing it one bit.</p>
			<p class="p">At any rate, there was an even bigger problem. He didn’t have enough money left on hand to afford the cost of going to the top-tier university he was supposed to be attending soon.</p>
			<p class="p">Because of the chronic state of war with the Galactic Empire, hugely expensive military appropriations were putting a strain on the national budget, and funding for education in the humanities—which had no direct military applications—kept getting cut. It was hard to get a scholarship.</p>
			<p class="p">It seemed as if there would be no school anywhere where one could study history for free … and yet there was one.</p>
			<p class="p">And the National Defense Force Officers’ Academy, with its Department of Military History, was it.</p>
			<p class="p">Just before the deadline, Yang sent off his application, and although his entrance exam results placed him far indeed from the head of the class, he somehow managed a passing score.</p>
			<div class="keep"><h3 class="h">V</h3>
			<p class="paft">In this way, Yang Wen-li entered officer’s school entirely as an expedient. Despite the fact that he was a stranger to both patriotism and belligerent militarism, his course had been set.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="p">Almost all of the mountain of junk he had inherited from his father he threw away—though he did put some of it into storage—and he moved into the officer’s school dormitory quite literally empty-handed.</p>
			<p class="p">His motives being what they were, there was no way Yang was going to be a top-level student. He diligently studied his military history—and all the wide range of nonmilitary history that made up its background—but he skimped as much as possible on his other subjects.</p>
			<p class="p">Particularly in the areas of weapons training, flight class, and mechanical engineering—the boring subjects—he was perfectly happy getting grades that hovered just above failing.</p>
			<p class="p">If he did fail, though, there was the danger of being expelled, and even if he weren’t expelled, the makeup tests would take up precious time. The point being that as long as he didn’t fail, it was okay. His goal was not to be the director of Joint Operational Headquarters, the secretary of the space srmada, or the superintendent general of staff. He wanted to be a researcher at the Military History Collation Office. He had practically no interest at all in advancement as a soldier.</p>
			<p class="p">His grades in Military History were outstanding, and combined with his nap-of-the-earth marks in all the practical subjects, produced a total that was the very picture of “average.” However, Yang’s marks in Strategic Tactical Simulations weren’t bad at all. Grades in this class were determined by having the students face off against one another in VR simulations. The instructors were shocked one day when the class’s top student—a boy named Wideborn, who was touted as the most brilliant student the school had seen in the last decade—was soundly defeated by Yang Wen-li.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang focused all of his forces on one point, cut his opponent’s supply lines, and then switched over to a purely defensive posture. Wideborn, using a variety of tactics, penetrated deep into Yang’s ranks, but when his supplies ran out, he had no choice but to retreat. Both the computer’s judgment and the instructor’s scoring awarded the victory to Yang.</p>
			<p class="p">Wideborn, whose pride had been wounded, was furious. “I’d have won if he’d played it straight and fought me head-on. I mean, all he did was keep running back and forth to get away, right?”</p>
			<p class="p">Yang didn’t argue. For him, this class was making up for his low marks in Mechanical Engineering, and with that, he was satisfied in full.</p>
			<p class="p">That satisfaction, however, was to be short-lived.</p>
			<p class="p">At the end of his second year, Yang was summoned by an instructor and ordered to switch his major to Military Strategy.</p>
			<p class="p">“It’s not just you,” the instructor had said, trying to be consoling. “They’re doing away with the whole military history department, so every student there has to change majors. You beat that Wideborn fellow in the simulation. That’s an achievement. You should change departments anyway, just to make the most of your talents.”</p>
			<p class="p">“I came to this school because I wanted to study military history,” Yang objected. “I don’t think it’s fair to recruit students and then scrap their department before they graduate.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Cadet Yang, you may not be on active duty yet, but from the moment you entered this school, you became a soldier. This is how petty officers get treated. And as a soldier, you have to follow your orders.”</p>
			<p class="p">Yang said nothing.</p>
			<p class="p">“But listen, there’s no way this is a bad deal for you. Military Strategy is a department that’s packed with top-level students. Students who try to get into Strategy but don’t make it flow into other departments. That’s the reality here. It’s a rare thing for someone to flow the other way.”</p>
			<p class="p">“I’m honored, sir, but … do I sound like a top-level student to you?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Watch it with the sarcasm. Anyway, if you don’t like it, you’ve got the right to quit, naturally. Of course, if you do that, you’ll have to pay back all the tuition and school fees you’ve accrued thus far. Only soldiers get to study for free.”</p>
			<p class="p">Yang was dumbstruck. He couldn’t help remembering what his late father had said about money. Truly, with people being people, you could never be free in this life.</p>
			<p class="p">At age twenty, Yang graduated from the military strategy department with average grades and received his commission as an ensign. A year later, he was promoted to sublieutenant, but that was normal for graduates of the Officer’s Academy. It didn’t mean that his service record was particularly outstanding.</p>
			<p class="p">He was assigned to an office at the Joint Operational Headquarters called the Office of Records and Statistics, and no one distinguished themselves in combat there. But for Yang, it was rather pleasant to have a job where he could be around old records.</p>
			<p class="p">However, simultaneous with his promotion to sublieutenant, Yang received orders for frontline duty. He departed for his new post as a staff officer for forces stationed in the territory of El Facil.</p>
			<p class="p">“When one thing goes crazy, everything goes crazy,” the young lieutenant junior grade grumbled.</p>
			<p class="p">Even though he had never once actively sought to become a soldier, here he was, wearing a black beret with a white five-pointed star mark, an ivory-white scarf tucked into the collar of his black jumper, black shoes, and slacks the same color as his scarf: an extremely functional military uniform.</p>
			<p class="p">That year, in SE 788, the Battle of El Facil greatly accelerated the course of Sublieutenant Yang Wen-li’s life.</p>
			<p class="p">The curtain rose on this battle with a scene of outrageous disgrace for the Free Planets Alliance’s navy. To the battle itself, both sides had dispatched in the neighborhood of a thousand vessels each, and after both sides had taken about 20 percent casualties, they had temporarily called it off. Yang did nothing during the engagement. All he did was sit in his station chair on the bridge of the flagship and watch the battle. He was not even asked for his opinion.</p>
			<p class="p">However, as the alliance ships were beginning their return to base, they were unexpectedly attacked from behind. The Imperial Navy, while pretending that they too were returning to base, had executed a rapid reversal of course and charged against the Alliance Navy, which had relaxed its guard and shown them its flank.</p>
			<p class="p">Spears of energy ripped through the blackness of space, and miniature novas flashed and vanished in an instant. The energies unleashed by destroyed vessels became a maelstrom, tossing other ships to and fro. Rear Admiral Lynch—the commander of the alliance fleet—must have panicked. Without trying to calm the confusion of his allies, his flagship fled back toward El Facil at full speed.</p>
			<p class="p">Upon learning that their commander had turned tail, the alliance fleet naturally lost its will to fight, and the ships that had been waging isolated battles with the enemies close at hand began to peel off and run from the field of battle, one after another. Some of them chose their routes of retreat independently and fled from the El Facil territory altogether, while others followed their flagship and escaped to the planet of El Facil itself. Ships that were late in retreating faced one of two fates: annihilation or surrender. Nearly all of them chose surrender.</p>
			<p class="p">Those surviving forces that had escaped to El Facil still numbered as many as two hundred vessels and fifty thousand soldiers, but the Imperial Navy afterward reinforced itself, building its forces up to three times that number, planning to leap at the chance to “liberate the El Facil territory from the clutches of the rebel forces” in one fell swoop. El Facil’s civilian population of three million cowered in the midst of this tense situation. It was already too late to stop El Facil from falling.</p>
			<p class="p">The civilians came to negotiate with the military, seeking the creation and implementation of a plan for planetwide evacuation. The officer in charge who appeared before them was Sublieutenant Yang Wen-li.</p>
			<p class="p">He was too young, and his rank was low. Was the military even taking them seriously? The civilians had their doubts, but Yang did a good job with everything he was supposed to do, even though he kept scratching his head in a way that didn’t inspire confidence. Amid the chaos of the impending imperial invasion, Yang procured civilian and military vessels and made preparations for the evacuation.</p>
			<p class="p">Even if Yang had not been there, any competent military officer could have done that much. Yang apparently calmed the impatient civilians while awaiting the chance to depart.</p>
			<p class="p">The next day, an urgent message came through that shocked everyone. Rear Admiral Lynch was in the process of fleeing from El Facil with his direct subordinates and the military provisions. He had abandoned the civilians and his other subordinates.</p>
			<p class="p">To the panicked civilians, Yang finally gave instructions to evacuate … in the direction opposite of Lynch’s course.</p>
			<p class="p">“There is no need for concern,” he told them. “The rear admiral is drawing away the Imperial Navy’s attention for us. We can escape now if we just ride the solar wind in a leisurely way and avoid using radar permeability devices or anything like that.”</p>
			<p class="p">With that casual decision, the young sublieutenant transformed his own fleet commander into a decoy.</p>
			<p class="p">And his prediction was dead-on. Rear Admiral Lynch and the others were spotted by the Imperial Navy, which had been sharpening its claws in anticipation of him trying just such a thing. After being run to and fro like hunted animals, the alliance vessels finally raised a white flag and were taken captive.</p>
			<p class="p">Meanwhile, the convoy of vessels led by Yang was leaving the El Facil system and making a beeline for territory to the rear. They were spotted on the Imperial Navy’s detection grid, but thanks to the preconceived notion that evacuation ships would be equipped with some kind of antidetection system—and the fact that they did show up on radar—the ships were thought to be not man-made objects, but a large swarm of meteors, and thereby they slipped out right under the enemy’s noses.</p>
			<p class="p">Later, when the officers of the imperial fleet learned about this, wineglasses that had been raised in victory toasts were smashed to the floor. Yang arrived in territory to the rear of El Facil with three million civilians, and cheers of welcome were waiting.</p>
			<p class="p">Like a meteor shower, words of praise for Yang’s composure and daring rained down from the high chiefs of the military. They had no choice. After all, their navy had lost the battle, fled from the enemy, and finally abandoned the very civilians that they were supposed to be protecting. In order to wipe out such a blot of disgrace and dishonor, the leadership needed a military hero. Hence: “Yang Wen-li: a paragon of the fighting men of the Free Planets Alliance.” “A warrior shining with the light of justice and humanity.” “Let all the soldiers of the alliance praise this young hero!”</p>
			<p class="p">That year, on June 12 of the standard calendar, at 0900, Yang was promoted to full lieutenant. On the same day at 1300, he was made a lieutenant commander. Military regulations stated that special double promotions were not permitted for living officers, but this unusual treatment was arranged by the upper echelons.</p>
			<p class="p">The man himself was far less excited than those around him. Shrugging his shoulders, he just muttered, “What in the world is all this?” and that was that. The only thing he was happy about was that he got a pay raise with the promotions, which meant he’d be able to fill his library with the history books he’d always wanted.</p>
			<p class="p">However, this was also the time when Yang first felt a real interest in military strategy.</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">Basically, the fundamental nature of combat hasn’t changed at all since three, four thousand years ago,</span> Yang thought, comparing his experiences to his knowledge of military history. <span class="i">Before you get to the battlefield, resupply is what counts. And after you get there, it’s the quality of the commanders. Victory or defeat hinges on these two things</span>.</p>
			<p class="p">There were many ancient proverbs that emphasized the importance of commanders. “A fearless general has no cowardly soldiers,” for example, or “A hundred sheep led by a lion will triumph over a hundred lions led by a sheep.”</p>
			<p class="p">The twenty-one-year-old lieutenant commander knew better than anyone the reason for his success. It was because the imperial military—and that of the alliance as well—had a blind faith in scientific technology, and the result of it was preconceived notions such as, “If it shows up on radar, it must not be an enemy ship.”</p>
			<p class="p">Nothing was more dangerous than ossified wisdom. And when he thought about it, wasn’t that also the reason he’d been able to beat Wideborn in the simulator back in his academy days? He’d been able to surprise an opponent who had clung to the idea of a decisive frontal assault.</p>
			<p class="p">Know the psychology of your enemy. That was the most important point of military strategy. And after that was the point that on the battlefield, resupply is absolutely essential in order to make good use of your resources. Taken to extremes, you didn’t even need to strike the enemy’s main force at all—it was enough if you could just cut their supply lines. If the enemy couldn’t fight, they’d have no choice but to withdraw.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang’s father had emphasized the value of money in every aspect of his life. If you treated the entire military as a single individual, money would be the supply line. When he thought about it that way, his father’s words turned out to be pretty valuable after all.</p>
			<p class="p">After this, nearly every other time that Yang participated in combat operations, he would mark up an unexpected achievement of some kind. And with those achievements came promotions to commander, then captain, and by age twenty-nine, commodore. His old classmate Wideborn was a rear admiral, but that was because as a captain he had stuck to orthodox strategy, taken a surprise attack head-on, and thus received a special double promotion posthumously.</p>
			<div class="orn"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="stars illustration" class="calibre5"/></div>
			<p class="paft">And now Yang Wen-li was in the Astarte Stellar Region.</p>
			<p class="p">Suddenly, a commotion broke out on the bridge. Not a pleasant one. It had been caused by an urgent message received from the surveillance craft.</p>
			<p class="p">“The imperial fleet is not in the area we predicted. They are accelerating rapidly and will intercept the Fourth Fleet.”</p>
			<p class="p">“What?!” Paetta cried. His voice was shrill and tinged with hysteria. “That’s insane … They wouldn’t!”</p>
			<p class="p">Yang reached over to his console and picked up the document lying almost shamefacedly there. A paper document. Four thousand years had passed since the ancient Chinese had invented the stuff, but humanity had still not come up with anything better for writing on. The document was the operations plan he had submitted earlier. He fanned through the pages. Lines of text written in the impersonal letters of his word processor jumped out at him.</p>
			<p class="exts">… if the enemy wishes to take aggressive action, they may view these circumstances not as a threat of envelopment, but as a prime opportunity to attack our divided forces and destroy them individually. Should this happen, the enemy will first take the offensive against the Fourth Fleet, which is positioned directly ahead of them. The Fourth Fleet is numerically the smallest and therefore the easiest to attack and defeat. Furthermore, after defeating the Fourth Fleet, the enemy will then be able to target the Second Fleet or the Sixth Fleet at its discretion. One way to resist this strategy is as follows: After meeting their challenge, the Fourth Fleet should return mild resistance for a time, then begin a slow withdrawal. As the enemy pursues them, the Second and Sixth fleets will strike them from behind. When the enemy turns to engage, the Second and Sixth fleets will return mild resistance while withdrawing, and then this time, the Fourth Fleet will strike from behind. Repeat until the enemy is exhausted. Then surround and destroy. This strategy has a very high probability of success, but close attention to force concentration, communication, and flexibility in advance and pullback is essential.</p>
			<p class="p">Yang closed the folder and glanced up at the ceiling’s wide-angle monitor. Hundreds of millions of stars were glaring back at him coldly.</p>
			<p class="p">The young commodore almost started whistling but stopped himself and began working busily at his console.</p>
